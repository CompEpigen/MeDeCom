# MeDeCom

MeDeCom is an R package for reference-free decomposition of heterogeneous DNA methylation profiles. 
It uses constrained matrix factorization enhanced by biologically-relevant constraints and a specially tailored regularization.
See MeDeCom [vignette](vignettes/MeDeCom.md) for a more detailed description and an example analysis.

# Publications

MeDeCom has originially been published in [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1182-6). Together with its accompanying packages [DecompPipeline](https://github.com/CompEpigen/DecompPipeline) and [FactorViz](https://github.com/CompEpigen/FactorViz), MeDeCom is part of a published [protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0369-6) for reference-free deconvolution of complex DNA methylation data (see also [http://epigenomics.dkfz.de/DecompProtocol/](http://epigenomics.dkfz.de/DecompProtocol/)).
