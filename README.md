#MeDeCom

MeDeCom is an R package for reference-free decomposition of heterogeneous DNA methylation profiles. 
It uses constrained matrix factorization enhanced by biologically-relevant constraints and a specially tailored regularization.
See MeDeCom [vignette](vignettes/MeDeCom.md) for a more detailed description and an example analysis.
